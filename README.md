## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository focused on natural language processing, with a particular emphasis on embeddings and semantic search. This space is a reflection of my ongoing research and experimentation in understanding language through vector representations and building systems that go beyond keyword matching to truly comprehend meaning and context.

My work centers around exploring how modern NLP techniquesâ€”especially transformer-based modelsâ€”can be leveraged to create efficient, accurate, and scalable semantic search systems. From generating high-quality sentence embeddings to fine-tuning models for domain-specific use cases, this repository highlights both foundational experiments and more advanced workflows aimed at pushing the boundaries of text understanding.

Projects here often revolve around key areas such as dense retrieval, vector similarity, approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search, and the integration of embedding models like Sentence Transformers or OpenAI's embeddings into real-world pipelines. I also explore how to evaluate semantic search systems using both quantitative metrics and qualitative insights.

This repository serves as both a research lab and a reference library. The goal is to make complex topics approachableâ€”through clear code, modular examples, and documented thought processes. Whether itâ€™s benchmarking different embedding models or testing new ANN algorithms, each project is grounded in curiosity, rigor, and a drive to make language-based systems smarter and more intuitive.

If you're working on search, chat systems, question answering, or any application where understanding meaning matters more than surface-level matches, I hope you find this work useful. Collaboration, feedback, and knowledge sharing are always welcomeâ€”NLP is evolving quickly, and thereâ€™s always more to learn.
